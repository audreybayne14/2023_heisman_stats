When Jayden Daniels was announced as the 2023 Heisman trophy winner, there was blacklash from CFB fans over whether or not he deserved to be the winner. Headlines included:
  "CFB Fans Sound Off on Jalen Milroe, Jordan Travis Snubs as Heisman Trophy Finalists" (Bleacher Report)
  "Heisman Trophy Voter's Controversial Top 3 Ballot Is Going Viral" (The Spun)

There are many factors to choosing the Heisman Trophy winner, and while some fanbases will always be disapointed by the outcome, 2023 seemed to have more controversy than normal.

In addition to my Python code (using numpy and scikit-learn's Linear Regression features), I included bar graphs of the following: 
  the actual points awarded to each player by the Heisman committee
  the points my model assigned to each player using the player's Fantasy Football points, Fantasy Football ranking, offensive yards per game, and offensive yards per play.

Spoiler alert: although I am an avid University of Alabama fan (and sincerely hope Jalen Milroe is a contender for the 2024 Heisman!), Jayden Daniels did come out on top in real life and in my model scenario. I was happy to see that Milroe came in 4th place in my rankings instead of 6th!

I will create a separate repository in December 2024 using similar code to predict the 2024 Heisman winner, so stay tuned (and roll tide)!
